<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
    <li>
      Process all the ingredients into a paste.
      <!--nesting lists-->
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
        </li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  

<p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

<!--description lists; <dl>
each term is wrapped in a <dt> description term,
each description is wrapped in a <dd> description definition element-->
<!--see example below-->
<dl>
    <dt>soliloquy</dt>
    <dd>
      In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner
      thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but
      not to other characters.)
    </dd>
    <dt>monologue</dt>
    <dd>
      In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them
      with the audience and any other characters present.
    </dd>
    <!--single term with multiple descriptions-->    
    <dt>aside</dt>
    <dd>
      In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
      humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of
      additional background information.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      In writing, a section of content that is related to the current topic, but
      doesn't fit directly into the main flow of content so is presented nearby
      (often in a box off to the side.)
