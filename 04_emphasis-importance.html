    <!--To emphasize important words, we tend to stress them in 
    spoken language and bold them in written language. For example:-->
    <p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>

    <p>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</p>

    <!--You can nest strong and emphasis inside one another if desired:-->
    <p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong> â€” if you drink it, 
        <strong>you may <em>die</em></strong>.</p>
